# Info
This repo contains bash script which allows you to get CEN XFS headers[^1] from pdf file.

Also I plan to add already generated headers for different XFS versions.

[^1]: Now you have to manually delete `CWA 16926-13:2020 (E)` labels and page numbers from generated `.h` file. I'm working on automatization of this process.
